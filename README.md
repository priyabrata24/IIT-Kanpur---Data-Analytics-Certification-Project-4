# Project-4 HR Attrition Issues
# Problem Statement: Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? 
# Aim: To build predictive model for response variable ‘left’ for Employees
# Data: They have given two datasets , hr_train.csv and hr_test.csv . We need to use data hr_train to build predictive model for response variable ‘left’. hr_test data contains all other factors except “left”, we need to predict that using the model that you developed and submit your predicted values in a csv files. We have to submit the probability scores.
# Methodology: We will build a ML - Random Forest Model to predict the response variable.
